WORK IN PROGRESS:
    1. Local Rotation.
    2. Array distributed on a curve.


Advanced Modifier Array v0.5 beta3 new features and fixed bug (from v0.5.2) 14\12\2011:

    1.  FIX: "Start Cap" and "End Cap" appears in "Curves" without "Curve Cap".
    2.  FIX: Fixed a display bug in "Edit Mode" of the "Mid Cap".
    3.  FIX: Initialization of variables for the rand offset.
    4.  UPD: New UI and improvements, based on PDF of Leandro Cavalheiro.
             (https://github.com/ruesp83/Blender---AMA/blob/master/patch-ama/pdf/array_ui.pdf)
    5.  UPD: Two ways to use the modifier:
             - "REGULAR" : Standard Method of cloning.
             - "PATH"    : Cloning along curve.
    6.  UPD: The "Offset Between" is now in the "Fit Type".
    7.  ADD: Ability to bind object "Mid Cap" to a different curve from that of the copies.
    8.  ADD: Ability to add to the curve of the "Mid Cap" also "Start Cap" and "End Cap",
             respectively the first and last Control Points.
    9.  ADD: "Scale" can have negative values, to create clones smaller than the original.
    10.  ADD: The "Mid Cap" is subject to noise, but only in the "Sequence".
    11. ADD: "Start Cap - Mid Cap - End Cap" now have the ability to use a random material
             belonging to the object cloned.


Advanced Modifier Array v0.5 beta2 new features and fixed bug (from v0.5.1) 3\11\2011:

    1. ADD: Ability to add a "Mid Cap" in various sequences and on "Control Points" of a Bezier
            and NURBS curve.
    2. ADD: Ability to add multiple clones of a "Mid Cap".


Advanced Modifier Array v0.5 beta1 new features and fixed bug (from v0.4) 27\08\2011:

    1. FIX: When you allocate a new clone, the assigned material is not the first but the next.
    2. ADD: Added option "Sequence" in the tab "Advanced Material".
    3. ADD: Possibility of repeating a material many times, in the mode: "Sequence".
    4. ADD: Ability to add a central object "Mid Cap".


Advanced Modifier Array v0.4 new features and fixed bug (from v0.3) 17\08\2011:

    1.  FIX: Failure to deallocate the last clone.
    2.  FIX: The Dupli Group maintains the "Noise Offset" even if the Advanced Noise
             is disabled.
    3.  FIX: Elimination from the undo of the button "Refresh For. Offsets". So the undo of
             the clones work well.
    4.  FIX: The functions for the "Offset Noise" now use the functions in "BLI_rand.h".
    5.  FIX: "final_offset" was calculated with a clone more.
    6.  ADD: Each clone can now be associated with a random element of the "Dupli Group".
    7.  ADD: The "Dupli Group" respects the "Restrict Mode" of the modifiers.
    8.  ADD: Updating the "Count" when you change the "Fit Type" except for "Fit Length".
    9.  ADD: New UI.
    10. ADD: The "Noise Offset" for Loc-Rot-Scale now has no limits.
    11. ADD: The "Offset Noise" now has 5 decimal digits.
    12. DEL: Elimination of the "noise factor".


Advanced Modifier Array v0.3 5\03\2011:

    1.  ADD: Random variation of the position, with the choice of direction.
    2.  ADD: Noise Factor: multiplicative offset value.
    3.  ADD: Lock offset.
    4.  ADD: Saving and reading the offset locked.
    5.  ADD: Offset for scaling and rotation. (The rotation is based on the center of
             the main subject)
    6.  ADD: Distributes the elements in a circle on an axis to choose.
    7.  ADD: Material random to each cloned.
    8.  ADD: Ability to tie a group array.
    9.  ADD: Cloning between two points.
             Feature inspired by Mode 501: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mInaC4t8Vcc
    10. ADD: New UI.
    11. ADD: The noise offset is now updated only when pressing "Refresh Ad. Offset",
             inherent to the style of Blender.

TODO:

    - ALTA  :
        - Dupli Group:
        - - Assign the material of the clone to "Dupli Group" inherent.
        - - Material at random also the "Dupli Group".
        - Enter a button to the randomization of the materials. So it does not change the rand 
          offset.
        - Associating a curve to the array.

    - MEDIA :
        - Add offset to the rotation on its axis.
        - Choose the direction of the offset for the X-Y-Z.
        - To activate the "Dupli Group" even when you press the button "Apply" of the modifier.
        - Assign a color ramp to the modifier array for color gradient.
        - Mid Cap:
        - - Allow to merge to the clones (Merge Verts).
        - OB-CAP: Keep the original material for each Cap.
        - Create a form to aspirale with clones.
        - MultiScatter.

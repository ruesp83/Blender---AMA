    - Nice modification to array modifier! I still wish there was a way to do “color offsets” 
      R,G, & B) with materials so you could have an array of objects with colors gradually 
      changing depending on their index number.
    
    - Bel cambiamento del Array modifier!! Mi piacerebbe che ci fosse un modo per fare un 
      "color offset" (R, G, B) con i materiali così si potrebbe avere un array di oggetti con un
      cambiamento di colore graduale, dipendente dal numero di indice
    
Ignatz:
    - The new noise function in the Array modifier is very interesting but is not stable.
      This issue demonstrates itself in a number of ways.
      1) Reloading a saved file where the array modifier has been used with noise always presents a 
         different random result. One would assume that saving a file with this feature enabled would
         bring one back to the same (model) position and form.
      2) Using the APPLY button on the array modifier when noise is used will not present you with 
         the mesh in the form it was last in. It appears that the noise “reshuffles” itself just before
         the apply actually happens. In other words, you don’t get what you expect.
      3) If you use UNDO with this function then, again, you never return to the last postion
         which you expected, but rather some other random noise position.
      [ Note: I realize that this patch is a work in progress, but the observations are valid,
              nevertheless. ]

      Blender version: 2.56 r35391
      Windows XP Pro 32-bit SP3
      Intel Q9450 4gig RAM
      NVidia GeForce 9600GT (driver 6.14.12.5721)

    - La funzione per il disturbo dell'array è molto interessante ma poco stabile!!
      Questo problema si dimostra in vari modi!!
      1)Rileggendo un file salvato dove il modifier array è stato usato con il noise, 
        presenta sempre un differente risultato random.
        Suppongo, che un salvataggio del file con questa feature abilitata porterebbe
        la stessa posizione e forma.
      2)Utilizzando il tasto "Applica" il noise viene ricalcolato poco prima di essere applicato.
        In altre parole non si ottiene quello che vi aspettate!!
      3)Se si utilizza "UNDO" con questa funzione, ancora una volta, non ritorna all'ultima 
        posizione che vi aspettate, ma qualche altra posizione casuale.
      [Nota: Mi rendo conto che questa patch è un work in progress, ma tuttavia le osservazioni 
             sono valide!!]
             
Jim:
    - Outstanding!  Well done!

TheNiceGuy:
    - AWSOME!!!!

T.E. Mencer:
    - That's ... actually pretty stinkin' cool. At first I was all "yaawwwwnnnn boring .." and then 
      you get to the more actually advanced stuff and I went *POP!* "Hey this is really slick!"
      Yes, I have sound effects in my head. Goes well with the voices.

    * Benjamin Lindquist:
        - It's probably quite hard to show off all the coding work in a video without voiceover, 
          I pretty much agree though...
          Your comment was amusing either way. :D

        * T.E. Mencer:
            - I think my comment was a product of two things:
              1)Too much coffee 2) Too much sugar
              I'm sure other elements are at play, but I'll blame those two specifically.

Jiggles100:
    - trunk!!!
  
Somebody
    - I'd sure like to see this in trunk.

MalPraktis:
    - This is just what I have been waiting for.  This will definitely speed up some of my projects.
      Put this in the TRUNK!!!

LoganRi:
    - Great, this is awesome. I really dig the new cloning options.

Steve Alvis:
    - While you are tinkering with the array modifier code, is it easy to modify the color of the 
      objects in an array in even increments (say by hsv or rgb) as defined by an offset or something
      of the like?  It would be kinda neat to be able to do this without making 100 different materials 
      by hand.

    * Nicholas Rishel:
        - Sounds like a job for Python scripting.

Johny:
    - Fabio, i was very impressed with an earlier version but personally i really wanted to be able
      to have local rotation for copies and now you've perfected it with that.
      Amazing work.. this should be in trunk.
      Hoping for an OS X version on Graphical....sniff sniff.
      Until then... is it possible to have this as an addon? or patch the core files yourself?

Meloware:
    - The 64 bit Windows build on Graphicall.org at rev. 43124 doesn't run, for me.
      libgomp-1.dll and possibly other libraries are missing. I was able to run the 32 bit version
      okay.

Eonmachrealm:
    - This is the kind of things that should be done IMHO, extending and perfecting the available tools!!!
      nice, nice, nice
      Trunk trunk trunk!!!!

Drxms:
    - A very usefull modifier.

DimitrisC:
    - Can anyone please tell me why we can't apply the same array modifier on more than one objects?
      Let's say I got a street light (two objects, the mesh and the actual light/spot) and I want to 
      clone them along a road. It should be fairly easy, you make the light a child of the mesh and 
      use an array modifier on the father (mesh). Boom! Cloned street lamps! Set the amount,distance
      and you're ready! I can't even use array mod. on lights. You can create instances and clones 
      of object groups (groups that may carry lights, another array, extruded splines, meshes, text etc) 
      in C4D since 2007-8. I'll agree with Eonmachrealm, perfecting the existing tools should be a priority.
      The example is pretty nice and it's a step to the right direction btw.

    * surt:
        - Because a modifier is for modifying (a mesh). You want to instance, so use instancing.

Kirill Poltavets:
    - Fabio makes simple but pretty useful tool! MidCap is great feature for creation of modern 
      buildings. With current standard Array Modifier you need to check different meshes to fit 
      everything exactly and make different complex combinations. I see that AMA is capable to solve
      these headaches.
      Randomization features are really great too! Also it will save a lot of memory if will be 
      implemented with the support of Instances code (as an option probably). I'm not sure it's possible 
      but I crave for this! Current Particle System code is really unintuitive in cases of 
      "instance modelling" and deals (usually) with normals so you need to perform some tricks if 
      you want simply to create that wall of bricks without a serious memory waste.
      I hope that further AMA will be improved even more! Now it must be completed and will be send 
      in Trunk at least as an alternative to the standard Array.

Olaf:
    - Excellent! Is this in SVN already?

Danni Coy:
    - That's pretty awesome - what would make it even more awesome is if you could apply the modifier 
      to a group and have it use one random object from that group in each iteration of the array 
      that way you could for instance model a bunch of similar size but different looking planks and 
      use the array to form a walkway where the planks all look sufficiently different 
      (does that make sense?)

Mike:
    - I'd love to see it in trunk its wonderful piece of work! Also if you could add a scale factor 
      as well ass the other (rotation, location) would be handy. For example to create arrays with
      objects that vary in size ... like an array of books sitting on a shelf, or bottes sitting in 
      a row .. as its very painful to create that with particles at the moment.

Peter:
    - fantastic! could you please develop it further, to use it for animation? 
      (like noise speed, random mat. change speed, etc...)
      Fantastic what you're doing, keep it up!
      
MoolahNasreddin:
    - Fabio, thanks for your addon!
      It's really useful!
      I just want to note that Noise in options always picks different values. I created two Arrays with noises and then moved first after second, noted elements positions, then made swapping again and few times. It's always different. And I find that this noise isn't connected to the object but it's connected to Global. So when you move object - noise is "waving" all the way.
      Please make the "seed" option. I think that it's already present in Blender (in Particles at least). Sometimes it's necessary to get the same results every time you're loading your file.
      P.S. Also please make 5 digits after "." if it's up to you.

Hypnosis Group:
    - Cool. Why not realtime changes?

Patrick Boelens:
    - Woah, great progress; loving this modifier already! I'd like to make a few feature requests if
      you don't mind though. =)
      1) I see you applying loc/rot/scale a lot to make sure everything works; perhaps a "local transform" 
        checkbox would be nice?
      2) In the local transform offsets, I'd love to be able to set a minimum and maximum for both location, 
        rotation and scale separately (i.e.: 3 rows with 2 columns each). This would provide more flexibility 
        and remove the use of the + and - checkboxes.
      3) Also in the random offsets, instead of having a refresh button, I think a seed field would be 
        be better suited. That way we could have real-time changes in the viewport as Hypnosis Group 
        suggested, and also go back and revise/ copy (previous) versions.
      Now I have to admit I haven't grabbed a build just yet (sorry) and I haven't been actively following 
      development, so apologies if this is already implemented/ in the planning. ;)
      Cheers, Patrick

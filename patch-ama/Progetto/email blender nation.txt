Hello everyone!
I would like to point out the new article on my blog: http://ruesp83.wordpress.com/
about donations, in order to have the possibility to spend more time developing the patch of  Advanced Modifier Array.
Your donation will be used to continue to improve this patch and make me able to realize what I can do better.
Thank everyone in advance for your contribution!

Best regards,
Fabio Russo (ruesp83)
